### Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Rock, Paper Scissors is a game very popular since I was in elementary. The mechanics of the game is very simple: You have to beat the Computer by winning first in five scores.

#### PROGRESS

There's still some cleaning to do with my code but I'm satisfied with the simplicity of the UI design of the game. I will do some modification with the animations and add some details, but right now, I am glad that it does its purpose.
